**About Me**

Hey! My name is Oli. I'm a prospective LBG Data Science and Analytics graduate, based in Bristol. Over the next few years, I'm hoping to learn as much as I can about the modern data ecosystem in Industry, laying the foundations for an exciting career in data! On this site, I'm planning to chart my thoughts along this journey, with the aim of slowly building up a body of writing that I can be proud of.

Before Lloyds, I completed a placement year in the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero. I worked with a fantastic team researching the techno-economically feasible and social least-cost pathways towards the decarbonisation of UK industry. After a lot of learning, coding and networking, I emerged from DESNZ a changed man! My currently thinking has been heavily informed by this experience. I've been inspired by some fantastic colleagues. I've seen and got really excited by what data can do. I've also left with a deep conviction that the energy transition needs to be community led. DESNZ was an utter blessing!

Between 2021 and 2024, I completed by maths undergrad at Warwick. The course was just *fantastic*. Bloody hard at times, but very fun. My highlights were Mathematics of ML, Complex Analysis (so pretty!) and High Dimensional Probability. I'm taking a break from formal education for now, but my self-study will continue! I hope my blog can form part of this.

**About My Blog**

In our modern slot machine media economy, it's super easy to just passively consume content without reflection. I'm certainly guilty of this. I want to make a shift from being this passive consumer to an active producer - to become someone who actually *does shit*. Moreover, I've always loved my writing and want to develop my own voice hence...weekly blog posts! 

To make this happen, on the axis of time spent, each post will lie closer towards the 'unfiltered first-draft' than the 'fully-formed thesis'. Therefore, please don't take these posts as a perfect representation of what I believe or the best possible treatment of these ideas. They will be a snapshot of my thinking in time rather than a full, serious treatment of a topic.
