2025 has been a big year! I finally took the plunge and did the big shave, writing about the experience [here](https://oliverkiranbrown.github.io/writing/taking_the_plunge/). Later on, I heard about this writing project called *[I thought about that alot](https://www.ithoughtaboutthatalot.com)* and loved the concept:

>Each contributor describes one thing they have thought a lot about in 2025. A new essay will be published each day in the countdown to Christmas.

So I refreshed and condensed that longer piece, made a submission, and it's now live! Go check it out here: [*In 2025, I thought a lot about hairloss and masculinity*](https://www.ithoughtaboutthatalot.com/2025/hair-loss-and-masculinity). 

Here's to owning it in 2026, and spending alot less on shampoo than these fellas!!!
